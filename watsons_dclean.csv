Its revolutionary technology EYESL immediately targets eye bags & dark circles, by using a unqiue combination of clay minerals and a bi-peptide complex which will lead to strong skin tightening, a decrease of fluid accumulation under the eyes and a micro-muscular pause. These actions will help to reduce the puffiness of the eyes and eliminate the appearance of dark circles.Step 1:
Wash your face gently and pat dry.

Step 2:
Squeeze out a small amount of product on your fingertip. You should aim for the size of a grain of rice; any less will not be enough, and any more is generally too much and won’t fully absorb into the skin or could cause sensitivity. This is one of the key factors to make Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles work correctly.

Step 3:
Gently apply the cream on your entire under-eye area, and smooth it out from the inside to the outside with one finger. Blend in using a light gentle sweeping motion until the cream completely absorbs into the skin.

Step 4:
Remain expressionless for 2-3 minutes while the product dries to achieve dramatic results (fanning will accelerate the process). Simply tissue off the excess of cream with a bit of water if too much cream is applied. Wash hands and close the tube after use.

For under makeup:
First, apply your usual products (eye serum, daily moisturizer, etc.) and allow time for these products to penetrate the layers of your skin (a minute or two). Then you can apply a very thin layer of Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles to the targeted area as instructed above.

Skin dries up when it comes into contact with air. UV rays from the sun hurt skin as well. When skin dries, it also hardens.
The top layer of hardened skin prevents new skin below it from surfacing.
By gently massaging Cure onto your skin, dead skin cells are removed from the top 0.01mm layer of your skin.
Fresh, rejuvenated skin appear. They are remarkably adept at absorbing skin lotion.

Natural Aqua Gel Cure is a remarkable skin care product.
Cure is a fragrance-free, color free and preservative free product made from activated hydrogen water that prevents oxidation.
General chemical peeling uses strong acids (approx. pH1.3) to dissolve protein. Cure, on the other hand, gently catches dead skin cells on the surface of the skin and removes it. It helps skin metabolism functions better.
You will be surprised at how smooth your skin has become.
Beneficial effects of gel should last approximately 3 to 4 months if used properly once or twice a week.

Bioglan's Digest EZE is an extra strength digestive enzyme blend that helps provide extra important digestive enzymes to boost the body's digestion of all the major food groups. It can assist in promoting digestive function and can help you get the nutritional benefit from your daily food intake.

What are Digestive enzymes?
Without enzymes, complete digestion could not take place and the food we eat can't be properly absorbed and utilised by our body. If enzymes are insufficient or overloaded, food may pass through the digestive system without being fully digested. This means you may not be able to utilise all the beneficial nutrients from your food and it can cause discomfort like gas and bloating after eating.
Stress, a busy lifestyle and eating too fast or too much can have an effect on digestive function. Some people may notice that they avoid eating particular foods as it may cause discomfort. They may find that this is due to being low in particular enzymes. That's where DigestEZE can help.

Who Is Bioglan Digest Eze For?
• Sufferers of chronic indigestion
• People who find certain foods difficult to digest
• The elderly who have lowered HCl levels
• People who feel bloated or discomfort after eating

A gentle jelly that keeps babies' skin soft and smooth, helps to prevent diaper rash, heal dry skin and protect minor cuts. Babies have sensitive skin that needs specially formulated products – so it i s essential to choose gentle yet effective products, like Vaseline Jelly Baby.

Relieve and Prevent Diaper Rash Diaper rash is common in babies, so be prepared and have an effective remedy on hand. When your baby is suffering with diaper rash, it’s crucial to restore moisture and soothe the skin as quickly as possible. By creating a protective barrier to lock in moisture, Vaseline Jelly Baby prevents friction between diapers and baby’s skin to relieve and heal dry, chafed skin from diaper rash. It comes in a recyclable, flip - cap jar, making it convenient and simple to use, even when you’re on the go.

Gentle, Hypo - allergenic Formula Baby Vaseline Jelly is dermatologist - tested and specially formulated to soothe diaper rash. Like the original Vaseline Jelly, the Baby formula is made with 100% pure jelly, triple - purified to remove any impurities that could irri tate your child’s skin. Due to its non - comedogenic (doesn’t block pores) formula, Vaseline Jelly Baby can also be used as a daily moisturi zer to treat dry patches on your baby’s face and body, not just the diaper area. When used regularly as part of your diaper changing ro utine, it’s the perfect baby moisturizer to help prevent dry skin and chafing.

Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate Heptahydrate) is a water-soluble, bitter-tasting, white and colourless compound. The Salt derives its name from a bitter saline spring at Epsom, Surrey, England. But don’t mistake Epsom Salt for table salt. Table salt is Sodium Chloride and is an entirely different substance from Epsom Salt, which is made of Magnesium and Sulfate. Epsom Salt offers countless benefits that can soothe the body, mind and soul.  

FOR RELAXATION AND RELIEF OF MUSCLE ACHES

During times of stress, Magnesium is depleted in the body. When dissolved in warm bath water, Epsom Salt replenishes this level of Magnesium and the Magnesium ions help to produce Serotonin, a mood-elevating chemical within the brain that calms and relaxes the body, thus creating a feeling of calmness and relaxation. 

In addition, Epsom Salt draws toxins from the body, soothes the nervous system, reduces swelling and temporarily relieves muscle aches and stiffness of joints. The Magnesium in Epsom Salt acts as a muscle relaxant and relieves muscle aches. Experts believe that bathing with Epsom Salt at least three times a week also increases energy and stamina by encouraging the production of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). 

FOR FEET

Epsom Salt is widely used in foot bath treatments to relieve tired, aching feet through the muscle-relaxing properties of the compound. It also helps to remove feet odor and softens skin. 

FOR CONSTIPATION / TOXIN ELIMINATION

Epsom Salt is a natural laxative that can be used for short term relief of constipation. Taken internally, Epson Salt acts as a detoxifying agent for colon cleansing. The salt acts like a laxative by drawing water into the intestines from surrounding body tissues and can bring about temporary relief from constipation. Results are produced 30 minutes to six hours after ingestion. 

FOR CALMING HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN

Magnesium has a demonstrated calming effect and deficiency in Magnesium causes hyperactiveness, irritability, anxiety and muscle twitching or spasms. Sulfate has shown to be effective in improving nutrient absorption and toxin elimination. Since both Magnesium and Sulfate can be absorbed through the skin, many parents report that giving their child a warm bath with 1-2 cups of dissolved Epsom Salt just before bedtime helps calm them down and extend the child's sleep cycle and improves concentration.For the temporary relief of muscular aches and stiffness of joints - Dissolve 375g in an average sized bath of warm water.

As a fertilizer: To help overcome Magnesium, and Sulfur deficiencies in soil (symptoms include yellow discoloration between leaf veins and curling of leaves), spread Epsom Salts over the soil. For citrus crops, tomatoes, lettuces, and other plants, also apply as a foliar spray (375g to 20 litres). For further advice, seek the help of an agricultural specialist.

As a fabric softener: Place 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salts in the washing machine before commencing the rinse cycle.During hot weather or when left exposed, Epsom Salts lose some of the water responsible for its bright crystalline appearance and may acquire a white frosted appearance. This has no significant effect on its properties.

For centuries, olives have been highly regarded for their extraordinary healing powers. Scientific studies have identified a family of powerful antioxidant compounds called polyphenols. Olive polyphenols promote cardiovascular wellness and Skin Health, maintain Healthy joint functions and strengthen the immune system. 

OLIVA forte® is a unique, natural Health supplement containing HIDROX® a standardized freeze dried blend of organic olive juice patented by CreAgri. HIDROX® contains very high concentration of hydroxytyrosol, a natural olive polyphenols, with the highest level of free radical scavenging activity ever reported for any natural antioxidant compound. Hydroxytyrosol is a small molecule found in olives. It is easily absorbed into the gastrointestinal system and blood stream, and is able to penetrate body tissues. 

Research has shown that the presence of naturally occurring olive polyphenols aids in the body’s absorption of hydroxytyrosol. HIDROX® is the only formulation which retains many natural olive polyphenols present in the natural environment of olive juice, ensuring that hydroxytyrosol can be absorbed by the body easily.

Povidone-iodine solutions are a golden-brown colour because of the iodine content. This colour shows the area that has been treated and also denotes the activity of the product. As the iodine is depleted from the solution, the colour fades. When the colour fades to a light yellow, Betadine should be reapplied. In most cases Betadine antiseptics are non-irritating and non-stinging to the skin. They do not permanently stain the skin or natural fabrics and the treated areas may be bandaged, taped or otherwise covered.

- Used in both hospitals and households around the country
- Recommended for the treatment of minor cuts and abrasions and is also effective against school sores, tinea and ringworm.
- Betadine Antiseptic Liquid rapidly kills all bacteria and fungi commonly responsible for wound and skin infections.
- It is essentially non-irritating to skin and will not permanently stain skin and natural fabrics.Cuts wounds and abrasions: Apply Betadine Antiseptic Liquid undiluted liberally to the injured area using a cotton tipped applicator or cotton wool as desired. Wipe away from the cut and cover the surrounding area well. Alternatively Betadine Antiseptic Ointment may be used. Minor Burns: Cool immediately in cold water for 10-20 minutes. If red or blistered, cover with a non-stick sterile dressing and see a doctor. Blisters: If a blister breaks, it is especially prone to infection. For this reason, treat an unbroken blister as you would one that is broken. Apply Betadine Antiseptic Liquid or Ointment, next, cover with a non-stick dressing and secure in place with adhesive strapping or, if the blister is small, cover with a small adhesive dressing. Tinea (Athletes Foot): At the first sign of itching, reddening or peeling apply Betadine Antiseptic Liquid or Ointment liberally. Repeat application 3 or 4 times a day. Paronychia (Infected skin around the nails): Paronychia is inflammation involving the folds of tissue around the fingernail. At the first sign of infection apply Betadine Antiseptic Liquid or Ointment liberally to the affected area. Repeat application 3 or 4 times daily. Keep the affected area as dry as possible. Ringworm: Ringworm is another name for tinea. The term is generally used when the infection is found on skin areas other than the feet. It should be treated exactly the same way as tinea however, if the affected area is on the head (tinea capitis) it might require special treatment, such as shaving. In this case professional medical advice should be sought.Contains 10% w/v Povidone-Iodine.

- Most potent and bioavailable antioxidant
- Helps with Skin conditions due to auto immune disorders
- Supports cardiovascular wellness

For centuries, olives have been highly regarded for their extraordinary healing powers. Scientific studies have identified a family of powerful antioxidant compounds called polyphenols. Olive polyphenols promote cardiovascular wellness and Skin Health, maintain Healthy joint functions and strengthen the immune system. 

OLIVA forte® is a unique, natural Health supplement containing HIDROX® a standardized freeze dried blend of organic olive juice patented by CreAgri. HIDROX® contains very high concentration of hydroxytyrosol, a natural olive polyphenols, with the highest level of free radical scavenging activity ever reported for any natural antioxidant compound. Hydroxytyrosol is a small molecule found in olives. It is easily absorbed into the gastrointestinal system and blood stream, and is able to penetrate body tissues. 

Research has shown that the presence of naturally occurring olive polyphenols aids in the body’s absorption of hydroxytyrosol. HIDROX® is the only formulation which retains many natural olive polyphenols present in the natural environment of olive juice, ensuring that hydroxytyrosol can be absorbed by the body easily.
